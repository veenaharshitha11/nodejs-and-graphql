# GraphQL with Node.js and MongoDB
This project demonstrates how to set up a Node.js application using GraphQL and MongoDB. GraphQL allows clients to request exactly the data they need, while Node.js provides the server-side runtime for building the API. MongoDB is used as the database for storing data, and Express simplifies the development of the web server.
